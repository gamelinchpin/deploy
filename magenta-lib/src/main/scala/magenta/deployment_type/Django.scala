      |Deploys a Guardian django web application to a set of servers.
      |
      |This deploy type deploys a Django based web application. The target servers are assumed to be configured
      |using the usual Guardian configuration for a Django WSGI application running under Apache httpd. For each server
      |that is running the application the following steps are carried out:
      |
      | - block firewall
      | - copy package files to a versioned directory under `/django-apps/`
      | - create a new symlink to make the new versioned directory the new default
      | - gracefully restart httpd
      | - wait for the application port to open
      | - wait until all `healthcheck_paths` return healthy HTTP status
      | - unblock firewall
